## Climate change, short and long term (midpoint)
These two midpoint categories were updated to the IPCC2021 AR6 values. Note that damage categories for these categories
are still based on AR5 values and will be updated in later versions of IW+.

## Land occupation and transformation
The land type "unspecified" (e.g., Land occupation, unspecified) previously had a CF of 0. Now an average CF was 
calculated based on the land type used globally.<br>
Moreover, artificial water bodies are now associated to this newly created unspecified CF, rather than being associated
to the urban CF, which significantly reduces the impact on biodiversity of hydroelectricity for example.
