This project aims to parse the IMPACT World+ files from the original Microsoft access database to the different
implementation in the available LCA software (SimaPro, openLCA & brightway2). A developer version of IW+ is also parsed
and is made available in an Excel format. This version is aimed for entities wishing to integrated IW+ in their
tools/databases on their own.

In the end, IMPACT World+ will span over 5 different files, in different formats:
- the original Microsoft access database (referred to as the source version)
- the Excel version of IW+ regrouping characterization factors from the source version as well as additional
extrapolated CFs (referred to as the dev version)
- the IW+ version directly implementable in the SimaPro LCA software, in a .csv format (referred to as the SimaPro version)
- the IW+ version directly implementable in the openLCA LCA software, in a .zip format (referred to as the openLCA version)
- the IW+ version directly implementable in the brightway2 LCA software, in a .bw2package format (referred to as the
brightway2 version)
