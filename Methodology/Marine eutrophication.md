## Marine eutrophication indicators

Concerned impact categories:
- Marine eutrophication (midpoint)
- Marine eutrophication (damage)

### 1. Midpoint indicator(s)
The marine eutrophication midpoint indicator values come from Roy et al. (2012) 
[https://doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2012.07.069] for emissions in the air. For emissions in water, 70% of the N 
containing substances discharged is assumed to reach the coastal  zone as done in ReCiPe and EDIP 
(Goedkoop et al. 2013; Hauschild and Potting 2005;  Hauschild and Wenzel 1998). This reflects 
the fact that elimination due to denitrification in  anaerobic zones in freshwater is treated as a constant with a 
generic removal of 30 % in the  CARMEN European model used in both LCIA methods. Hence, 70 % of the nitrogen input 
transports to sea.

### 2. Damage indicator(s)
The marine eutrophication damage indicator values come from Roy et al. (2012) 
[https://doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2012.07.069] for air and the same approximation for water emissions as for the 
midpoint. The effect factor was determined by calculating the hypoxia rate in 3 environments (Gulf of Mexico, 
Chesapeake Bay and the Baltic sea) over different periods

### 3. Miscellaneous information
The base data covers three pollutant: HNO3, NH3 and NOx. The factors for other pollutants assessed in IW+ were 
estimated based on stoechiometric ratios.
