## Marine eutrophication indicators

Concerned impact categories:
- Marine eutrophication (midpoint)
- Marine eutrophication (damage)

### 1. Midpoint indicator(s)
The marine eutrophication midpoint indicator values come from Roy et al. (2012) 
[https://doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2012.07.069]. The reference substance is the emission of Nitrogen at the global 
scale in water.

### 2. Damage indicator(s)
The marine eutrophication damage indicator values come from Roy et al. (2012) 
[https://doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2012.07.069]. The effect factor was determined by calculating the hypoxia rate in
3 environments (Gulf of Mexico, Chesapeake Bay and the Baltic sea) over different periods

### 3. Miscellaneous information
The base data covers three pollutant: HNO3, NH3 and NOx. The factors for other pollutants assessed in IW+ were 
estimated based on stoechiometric ratios.
