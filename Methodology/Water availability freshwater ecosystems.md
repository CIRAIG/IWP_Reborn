### 1. Midpoint indicator(s)
The Water availability, freshwater ecosystem has no directly associated midpoint indaictor.

### 2. Damage indicator(s)
The Water availability, freshwater ecosystem damage indicator comes from Hanafiah et al. (2011) 
[https://doi.org/10.1021/es1039634]. The CF values from the table S4 (Supplementary information) are converted from
PDF.m3.yr/m3 to PDF.m2.yr/m3 by assuming a global average depth of river of 2.5m (same number as in Usetox). This 
indicator was not regionalized, and only the median value of all CFs was taken and globally applied.
