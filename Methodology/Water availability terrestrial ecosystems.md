## Water availability terrestrial ecosystem indicators

Concerned impact categories:
- Water availability, terrestrial ecosystem (damage)

### 1. Midpoint indicator(s)
The Water availability, terrestrial ecosystem has no directly associated midpoint indicator.

### 2. Damage indicator(s)
The Water availability, terrestrial ecosystem damage indicator comes from van Zelm et al. (2011) 
[https://doi.org/10.1021/es102383v]. The article estimates to 0.21 PDF.m2.yr/m3 (Figure 4 hierarchist value) the impact 
of consuming groundwater on terrestrial ecosystems. However, the authors note that this value depends on the depth of
the groundwater. The depth of groundwater is determined with this article from Jasechko et al. (2021) 
[https://doi.org/10.1126/science.abc2755]. By reading directly on the Figure 2 of the article, we extract the % of 
shallow well compared to deep well in 40 countries. We take the most recent values (2000-2015, in blue diamonds on the 
graph). Note that we consider that the proportion of water drawn from surface aquifers is the same as the proportion of 
the surface area of the countries where these surface wells are found.
The article also provides a global value of 1 out 5 wells that are shallow. The global default value was thus 
20% of shallow wells in each country not covered. This proportion is then multiplied by the 0.21 PDF.m2.yr/m3 factor of 
van Zelm et al. We also add the value of 0.21 for Netherlands which was directly given in van Zelm et al.
