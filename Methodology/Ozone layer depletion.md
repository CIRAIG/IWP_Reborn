## Ozone layer depletion indicators

Concerned impact categories:
- Ozone layer depletion (midpoint)
- Ozone layer depletion (damage)

### 1. Midpoint indicator(s)
The midpoint indicator in based on the Ozone Depletion Potentialvalues (ODP) provided by the World Meteorological 
Organization in their latest report (2022) in Table A-5
[https://ozone.unep.org/sites/default/files/2023-02/Scientific-Assessment-of-Ozone-Depletion-2022.pdf]. These ODPs are
at an infinite time horizon. Other LCIA methodologies like ReCiPe limit this potential to different time horizons, but 
IW+ took the decision to keep the infinite time horizon values.

### 2. Damage indicator(s)
To go from midpoint to damage we use the conversion factor from the ReCiPe2016 LCIA methodology. Since the midpoint
indicator in IW+ has an infinite time horizon, we use the egalitarian midpoint-to-damage-conversion factor which is
