## Mineral resource use indicator

Concerned impact categories:
- Mineral resource use (midpoint)

### 1. Midpoint indicator(s)
This indicator is based on the approach proposed by De Bruille, V. (2014). _Impact de l'utilisation des ressources 
minérales et métalliques dans un contexte cycle de vie : une approche fonctionnelle_ (https://publications.polymtl.ca/1591/).
It defines the fraction of users unable to adapt to depletion of reserves before reaching reserve base depletion time. 
The adaptation time for users is defined as a function of the substitutability of the resource (value between 0 and 1; 
1 for a non-substitutable resource and 0 for an easily substitutable resource in each technology) in all of the 
technologies in which it is used. If an important share of users is able to adapt quickly, the depletion time increase 
and let more time to users facing challenges to adapt, to indeed adapt and substitute the resource by another one in 
each technology.  The unit of CFs is kg deficit per kg dissipated.

### 2. Damage indicator(s)
The mineral resource use indicator has no directly associated damage indicators.
