## Photochemical ozone formation indicators

Concerned impact categories:
- Photochemical Ozone Formation (midpoint)
- Photochemical Ozone Formation, ecosystem quality (damage)
- Photochemical Ozone Formation, human health (damage)

### 1. Midpoint indicator(s)
The Photochemical ozone formation midpoint indicator is a copy from the ReCiPe2016 LCIA methodology. However, IW+ does 
not with to see a distinction between human health and ecosystem quality at the midpoint indicator (like what is done
within ReCiPe). As a result, the midpoint indicator of IW+ is based solely on the midpoint human health indicator of 
ReCiPe.

### 2. Damage indicator(s)
The Photochemical ozone formation damage indicator is a copy from the ReCiPe2016 LCIA methodology. However, ReCiPe 
operates in species.yr for their ecosystem quality indaictor while IW+ operates in PDF.m2.yr. The ecosystem quality 
damage indicator values were thus divided by the species density provided by the ReCiPe methodology (1.48e-8 species/m2)
