## Fisheries impact indicators

Concerned impact categories:
- Fisheries impact (midpoint)

### 1. Midpoint indicator(s)
There is no midpoint indicator for this impact category

### 2. Damage indicator(s)
The damage indicator for this impact category is based on the work of Stanford-Clark, et al. (2024) 
(https://doi.org/10.3390/su16093870). The CFs can be extracted from here: 
https://entrepot.recherche.data.gouv.fr/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.57745/9YSDIV. 
These CFs are not in IMPACT World+ ready format (they are based on speicies/yr). They were converted to PDF.m2.yr by 
dividing by the “global total” species richness and multiplying by the area.
