## Fisheries impact indicators

Concerned impact categories:
- Fisheries impact (midpoint)

### 1. Midpoint indicator(s)
There is no midpoint indicator for this impact category

### 2. Damage indicator(s)
The damage indicator for this impact category is based on the work of Stanford-Clark, et al. (2024) 
(https://doi.org/10.3390/su16093870). The CFs can be extracted from here: 
https://entrepot.recherche.data.gouv.fr/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.57745/9YSDIV. 
These CFs are not in IMPACT World+ ready format as they are provided by default in species/yr. They were converted to 
PDF.m2.yr by dividing by estimates of species richness per FAO fishing region, obtained from the database "WORMS". Then, 
we divide by the surface of each FAO zone. Surface data is taken from "Aquamaps". More information in the Appendix 2 of
C. Stanford-Clark's thesis.
