## Particulate matter formation indicators

Concerned impact categories:
- Particulate matter formation (midpoint)
- Particulate matter formation (damage)

### 1. Midpoint indicator(s)
The particulate matter formation midpoint indicator is the normalization of the damage indicator using the 
Particulates, < 2.5 um, global value for normalization.

### 2. Damage indicator(s)
The particulate matter formation damage indicator mainly comes from the work of Fantke, et al. 
(http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.7b02589 / http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.9b01800), which describes the intake 
fraction and effect factors for primary "Particulates, < 2.5 um" in cities of above 100,000 population. They also provide
these values for rural contexts (implicitly < 100,000 population). The CFs were aggregated at the country (e.g., CA), 
region (e.g., CA-QC), continent (e.g., North America) and global levels. This is thus a fully regionalized impact category.
The aggregation is based on the population in the given geography.
The Particulates, < 10 um values are calculated from the estimated ratio of PM2.5 in PM10 (~60% of PM2.5 within PM10), 
coming from the Table S2 of Humbert, et al. (https://doi.org/10.1021/es103563z). This value also corroborates with 
other research, e.g., see Figure 4 of Fan, et al.(https://doi.org/10.3389/fenvs.2021.692440).
For secondary PMs (e.g., SO2, NOx and NH3), the intake fractions come from Table 3 of Humbert, et al. 
(https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/es103563z). However, they could be updated in subsequent IW+ updates with the values 
from Figure 5/6 of Parvez, et al. (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2017.06.011) and new secondary PM pollutants could 
be added through that publication.
