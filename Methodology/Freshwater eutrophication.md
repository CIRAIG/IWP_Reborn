## Freshwater eutrophication indicators

Concerned impact categories:
- Freshwater eutrophication (midpoint)
- Freshwater eutrophication (damage)

### 1. Midpoint indicator(s)
The Freshwater eutrophication midpoint indicator values come from Helmes et al. (2012) 
[https://doi.org/10.1007/s11367-012-0382-2]

### 2. Damage indicator(s)
The Freshwater eutrophication damage indicator values are just the midpoint values multiplied by an effect factor. The 
latter was determined by calculating the hypoxia rate in 3 environments (Gulf of Mexico, Chesapeake Bay and the 
Baltic sea) over different periods [https://d38c6ppuviqmfp.cloudfront.net/content/publications/cbp_34915.pdf],
[https://gulfhypoxia.net/Research/Shelfwide%20Cruises/#Size].

### 3. Miscellaneous information
The base data covers one pollutant: phosphate. The factors for other pollutants assessed in IW+ were 
estimated based on stoechiometric ratios.
