## Thermally polluted water indicators

Concerned impact categories:
- Thermally polluted water (damage)

### 1. Midpoint indicator(s)
The thermally polluted water category has no directly associated midpoint indicator.

### 2. Damage indicator(s)
The thermally polluted water damage indicator is based on Verones, et al. (2010) [https://doi.org/10.1021/es102260c]. 
To derive an average global CF from th article, IW+ assumed a 3m deep river with a 4Â°C temperature increase as the 
average case. It resulted in a 4.11e-05 PDF.m2.yr/m3 CF.
